Does Vesta Equity Provide Loans?,"There is no lending on Vesta Equity. Property owners can list a portion of equity they want to sell by setting a percentage and a desired amount that accredited investors can negotiate and purchase. Once the transaction is approved by Vesta Equity, the investor fully owns the equity they’ve purchased and the property owner receives the negotiated funds. These funds belong to the property owner who can use them at their own discretion."
How does a homeowner cancel the Equity Sharing Agreement?,"The Equity Sharing Agreement between a homeowner, investors, and Vesta Equity usually ends when the homeowner decides to sell the property. This allows the homeowner to maintain ownership and residential rights to the property for as long as it makes sense to, and move on naturally when they're ready. A homeowner, however, might want to end the agreement without selling the property. In this case they can repay the better of 1) the value of the investment or 2) a minimum investor return as designated in the Equity Sharing Agreement. Once the investment is repaid, Vesta Equity will handle the required closing and confirm the end of the contract."
Who retains residential rights?,The property owner always retains residential rights and this is embedded in the smart contracts that both property owner and investor agree to. An investor has no rights to use or occupy the property in any manner whatsoever.
Is my money safe on Vesta Equity?,"All users are fully verified by the same industry-grade KYC/AML processes that banks and traditional financial institutions use. Digital wallets are fully custodied, which acts like having a safety deposit box in a bank vault, and funds used for transactions are peer-to-peer, going directly from the investor’s wallet to the property owner’s. Properties themselves are verified using data that originates from land title registries with a suite of leading property data services to validate their market values. Finally, Vesta Equity is added onto every property’s insurance policy to protect investors’ interests against insurable events."
Can I trust Vesta Equity?,"Vesta Equity was founded on the principles of transparency and disintermediation to help property owners realize the value in their property equity. We allow property owners to negotiate and transact directly with accredited investors who want to manage which properties they invest their money. So how do we make money? Vesta Equity’s fee structure is simple. We set a one-time, flat closing fee. With our solution, there are no monthly payments, accruing interest, or penalties."
What is tokenization and how does this apply to real estate?,"Tokenization is simply a secure process of storing economic value in a digital record, or token. Tokenizing a physical asset, such as a property, allows it to be made divisible and subsequently issued as digital tokens. These tokens are then recorded and transacted over a blockchain while still being represented by the underlying property."
What is blockchain and does Vesta Equity’s marketplace run on it?,"Blockchain is a powerful and revolutionary technology that allows digital records (data) to be made in a decentralized manner across a network (distributed ledger) and verified through consensus by multiple sources on the network. This prevents independent data warehouses from storing, manipulating, and creating monopolies over data for economic benefit. A very common type of data is a financial transaction, and on a blockchain this can be made using a digital token or a cryptocurrency. By using blockchain technology, Vesta Equity’s marketplace ensures that all transactions are fully auditable, immutable, and much quicker compared to traditional methods of transferring funds."
"What is a cryptocurrency, does Vesta Equity’s marketplace use them, and do I need to sign up for it?","A cryptocurrency is a digital currency with its own economic value that can be used for transactions over a blockchain or traded over exchanges. There are many different cryptocurrencies with a wide range of applications, and the most well-known examples are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Vesta Equity’s marketplace makes use of USD Coin (USDC), a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin which is pegged one to one (1:1) with the United States dollar. This means that one USD Coin will always be equivalent to one US dollar, making it an ideal currency to transact in. When money is moved into your wallet it is converted into USDC, and likewise, when money is moved out of your wallet it can be converted into US dollars or a fiat currency equivalent based on exchange rates. You do not need to sign up for USDC and your wallet enables you to transact in it automatically. In your user settings, you can express the currency you see on the platform as either US dollars or USDC."
Can I transact my equity assets outside of Vesta Equity’s marketplace?,"Equity assets purchased on Vesta Equity cannot be transacted outside of the marketplace. To convert equity, a liquidity event must occur which means that you must sell the equity proactively to other investors or it could be purchased through a property owner buyback term associated with the equity. Alternatively, the property itself could be sold in its entirety. In these scenarios you would receive the equivalent cash value and could reinvest in other properties or exit some of the proceeds from the sale event."
What is Circle?,"Founded in 2013, Circle is a global payments solution and stablecoin issuer based in Boston, MA. Circle enables businesses and individuals to conduct financial transactions on the blockchain because its faster, safer, and more efficient than traditional payment systems. The stablecoins issued by circle are built to a higher standard. That's why USD Coin (USDC) is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. To increase transparency, Circle publicly discloses its reserve assets on a monthly basis. Investors in Circle include BlackRock, Inc., Fidelity Management and Research, and Goldman Sachs. In February of 2022, Circle formalized plans to go public at an estimated valuation of $9 billion. Circle's stablecoin, USDC is available on multiple blockchains, including Algorand which powers the Vesta Property Marketplace."
What kinds of identification are required for signing up and why?,"A photo of a government-issued ID is required for authentication because of the stringent application requirements needed to obtain this identification. The piece of ID is validated by Vesta Equity using state-of-the-art KYC/AML services and ensures that your account is protected against unauthorized access. This method of verification is common in applications involving transactions with high-value assets on the internet, particularly with financial investments and real estate."
With a property owner account can I invest as well? With an investor account can I list equity in my property for sale?,"If you already signed up as a property owner you can also buy equity as an investor. Currently, however, all investors need to be accredited according to the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) criteria. If you signed up as an investor you can begin listing equity in your property right away by going through the basic property onboarding process."
Where are transactions shown and how can I see a complete list of transactions?,"Transactions are shown in various parts of the platform such as the Dashboard, and are available in full in the Wallet tab under your Account Settings. You can review and export them as needed, and they are fully recorded and immutable as part of the blockchain infrastructure powering Vesta Equity."

Why do i need to be accredited?,Only investors based in the United States need to be accredited to buy securities through the Vesta Property Marketplace. Digital securities on Vesta Property Marketplace are issued via Regulation D as outlined by the SEC. Regulation D requires that US investors be accredited.
"As a property owner, do I need to own my property fully to sell equity?",Vesta Equity is currently accepting properties that are wholly owned and debt-free as well as properties that are mortgaged or otherwise encumbered where the debt can be discharged through raising funds on our marketplace.
Are there really no monthly interest payments?,"Yes, Vesta Equity operates with only a platform fee paid at the time of each transaction. An initial closing cost fee comparable to other property financing products also applies once a property owner has decided to list. Vesta Equity also offers integrated services for property valuation and professional photography to assist with your listing."
Will selling some of my property's equity through Vesta Equity affect the sale of my entire property?,"Not at all. You would place your property for sale as usual and Vesta Equity would help arrange payment of the percentage of investor-owned equity. For example, if you had sold 20% of your property to Vesta Equity investors and decided to sell your entire property through a realtor, 20% of the funds received would be seamlessly disbursed by Vesta Equity to investors holding those tokens."
What is the maximum amount of equity I can sell?,You can sell up to 80% of your property's equity
I signed up as a property owner to list equity in my property. Can I also buy equity in other properties to diversify my portfolio?,"Yes, although investors in the US need to be accredited to buy equity. In the United States, the requirements to become an accredited investor are set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors who are domiciled outside of the US don't need to be accredited."
How accurate is the property value on a listing?,Every property on the marketplace has a value based on a formal valuation conducted an independent third party as a condition of listing coupled with real estate trend data from industry-leading sources applied thereafter.
What is the minimum offer amount that I can make?,You can buy as little as 0.1% of a property.
Can I withdraw my offer after submitting it?,"No, since the funds for the offer will be held in escrow after submission. The offer will only be sent if the funds backing the offer are available in your wallet. The offer remains valid for the property owner until the expiration timeline that is set on the offer. Likewise, if a property owner makes a counter-offer it is also valid until the end of the expiration timeline."
How can I cash out of my equity holding?,"There are three events that result in receiving payment in exchange for the equity you hold.
1) You choose to resell your equity to another investor on the marketplace.
2) The principal property owner of the property you own equity in sells the property to a new property owner. Vesta Equity will receive funds from the new property owner and make disbursements to investors holding equities in the property. The dollar amount will be the proportion of the equity hold relative to the property sale amount.
3) The original offer contained a buyback condition from the property owner which will execute at the end of the term."
Can I leverage the tokenized real estate assets I have invested in?,"To leverage an asset means you seek a loan by using the asset as collateral. The borrower is typically able to command a lower interest rate because an asset collateralizes the loan. However, the loan terms depend on a few factors, including the asset's perceived value and how leveraged the borrower may already be. The borrower's incentive for leveraging their asset might typically be to garner a loan at a lower interest rate so that they can purchase another asset that earns a return at a higher rate. Vesta Equity uses USDC, a leading and trusted stable coin pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, to settle the real estate transactions between buyers and sellers. As such, the real estate's value is always a true reflection of the market. There will be no volatility in an asset price due to crypto fluctuations. DeFi lending services and platforms allow people to borrow by putting up their cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets as collateral. This market is maturing rapidly, and interest rates per service are posted online. An accredited investor looking to leverage their holdings on Vesta Equity could seek a low-interest loan using their existing USDC backed tokenized real estate asset as collateral. They could then proceed to purchase additional equity on the Vesta Equity Marketplace with the goal of higher returns."
Is the value on a listing an appraised value or is it based on property market data?,"All listings on Vesta Equity's marketplace are supported by a market value estimate provided by an independent third party. This information is validated and is used to support any subsequent data-driven valuation updates. Once listed, market data will be routinely updated to complement the property valuation. If new valuations are conducted while the property is listed on the marketplace, the latest value estimate will be published. Vesta Equity uses both the value estimate and market data to provide the most accurate financial representation of the property at any given time. The valuations conducted by the independent third party are not considered appraisals."
Does Vesta Equity recommend or promote listings?,When browsing through listings on the marketplace you might see similar listings to those in a search or on a listing page itself. These are listings that share some of the same characteristics but are not recommended listings by Vesta Equity. This marketplace tool assists with searching but is not intended to advise investors or property owners with decisions they can make on the marketplace. Vesta Equity treats all listings equally and has no services to either promote listings or solicit investors.
How can I easily keep track of and compare listings against each other?,Each listing can be bookmarked by toggling the bookmark icon and bookmarks can be accessed from the marketplace panel on the dashboard. Even very similar properties can vary greatly in their features but one commonality is the dollar per square foot metric which is shown prominently on each listing.
If some equity on a listing does not sell for a long time will Vesta Equity remove it?,Vesta Equity provides a tool for property owners to manage their equity sale. We will never remove a listing unless it voids our terms of service and will leave it at the property owner’s discretion on when to remove it.
Can a listing change after being published on Vesta Equity’s marketplace?,A listing can be modified entirely before equity has been purchased from it. Once equity has been purchased the terms of the listing cannot be changed. This preserves the integrity of deals made on that listing. Any unsold equity on the listing can be removed at the property owner’s discretion. Future listings could reflect any appreciation or upgrades made to the residence.
Can I modify the offer after purchase?,"No, offers are final once accepted and approved by Vesta Equity. At that point, assets are exchanged and funds held in an investor’s escrow wallet are immediately transferred to the property owner’s wallet. The investor is issued tokens representing their share of the equity held in the property."
Can I list a second property such as a vacation property or rental unit? Do I need to list my primary place of residence first?,"As a property owner you can list equity in any property you own in any order, even if it is occupied by other residents. Investors purchasing equity have no residential rights to property and only acquire its equity as a financial asset. There are no separate requirements for properties if they are not your primary place or residence. You can also list equity from multiple properties at the same time and manage all listings from the main Listings screen."
Will I be taxed on income from sold equity?,Selling equity in your property can trigger capital gains taxes or real estate transfer taxes in the same way that selling your entire property on the real estate market traditionally can. Tax laws are very complex and vary across jurisdictions. Vesta Equity is not a tax advisor and cannot provide tax advice so we highly recommend that you consult a tax advisor before transacting on the marketplace.
What blockchain is Vesta Equity using for tokenizing real estate?,"We leverage Algorand's proof-of-stake blockchain infrastructure for tokenization. Algorand offers state of the art technology for tokenizing physical assets using their ASA (Algorand Standard Assets) functionality. In addition, due to the nature of Algorand's efficient infrastructure, transfer fees are extremely low and transfers are immediate."
How can I securely move funds in and out of my wallet?,"We've partnered with Circle to allow quick and efficient wallet transactions from any bank account in North America. You will be able to connect your bank account to move funds from your standard Algorand wallet to our platform, or get payouts within 2 business days."
Who stores my tokens?,We operate a fully distributed infrastructure. Property owners and investors on the Vesta Equity platform hold their own wallets and the contents of the wallet are securely stored on the public Algorand ledger network.
