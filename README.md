## How It Works üß†

1. **Data Processing**:
   - `faqs.csv` is loaded and processed using LangChain's `CSVLoader`.
   - Each FAQ is embedded into a vector space using HuggingFace's `InstructorEmbedding`.

2. **Vector Database**:
   - The FAQs are stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
   - The database is queried using cosine similarity to find the most relevant answers.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - OpenAI's LLM generates detailed answers based on the retrieved context.
   - The response adheres closely to the FAQ dataset, ensuring accurate and trustworthy answers.

4. **Streamlit Interface**:
   - A user-friendly web interface allows easy interaction, including FAQ processing and question answering.

## Example Dataset (`faqs.csv`) üìÇ

| **prompt**                           | **response**                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Does Vesta Equity Provide Loans?     | There is no lending on Vesta Equity. Property owners can list a portion of equity they want to sell by setting a percentage and a desired amount    |                                      | that accredited investors can negotiate and purchase. Once the transaction is approved by Vesta Equity, the investor fully owns the equity they‚Äôve   |                                      | purchased and the property owner receives the negotiated funds. These funds belong to the property owner who can use them at their own discretion.  |
